## Project Goals

### User Goals

- Generate a random workout for a user dependant on time
- Be able to log in/ register a new account.
- Log and update weights weights acheived in a previous workouts

## User Experience

### Target Audience

Aimed towards people aged 16+ (recommended age for starting gym work outs), general gym enthusiasts looking for random workouts and people who like to track their workout weights

### User Requirements and Expectations

- A simple, error-free workout creation tool
- Straightforward navigation
- Log personalisation once registered
- Adjustable log record

### User Manual

#### Main Menu
On the main menu, users are presented with an ASCII art rendering of the name 'Workout Log'. Below the welcome graphic there are a couple of options for user to select from.

## Technical Design

### Flowchart

The following flowchart summarises the structure and logic of the application.

</details>

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for the logic of the program

### Frameworks & Tools

- [Miro.com](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/) was used to draw the flowchart
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store the project code
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console/) was used to manage access and permissions for Google Services such as Google auth, sheets etc.
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) was used to store user details, user log and exercises for user
- [PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) used to validate my python code
- [Heroku](https://https://heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project into live environment
- [Gitpod Workspace](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) used to write the project code using Code Institute template

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
- random - used to randomise the workout when generating
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - used to carry out testing on single units in validation.py file

#### Third Party Libraries
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used this to add color to the terminal. I marked warning/error information with color red and user feedback with blue and green.
- [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used gspread to add and manipulate data in my Google spreadsheet and to interact with Google API.
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - JUSTIFICATION: module used to set up the authentification needed to access the Google API and connect my Service Account with the Credentials function. A creds.json file is created with all details the API needs to access the google account. In deployment to Render this information is stored in the config var section.
