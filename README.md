## About

This is a command-line version of a workout log and workout generator.

The aim is to build a place for a user to store weight logs to use when working out and be able to generate a workout for the user depending on how long the have available. Workouts are random each time dependant on time.

Selecting option 1 here to Workout, you will be asked how long you want to workout for, 15, 25, 45 or 60 minutes. Depending on your selection being 1-4, a random workout is generated giving x4 'warm up' exercises and increasing by 2 for each workout length, 6-10 'Main workout' exercises.

It is personalised using your user name. Following the workout being generated, you are returned to the 'user menu'

Clicking option 2 will take you to your personalised log, first it generates a full list of your exercises and the weights associated to each on, displayed in kg. 
You the are asked if you would like to adjust your log, y/n?

If no, you are returned to the user menu. 
If yes then you are asked which exercise you would like to adjust with prompt to enter the exercise, asked the new value and following updating your log, it asks if you would like to adjust another.

If no, your returned to the main menu. 
If yes, your log is regenerated for ease of viewing with all new values and prompted again to enter exercise/ new value. 

Selecting option 3, 'Exit' the user quits the workout log and exits the terminal.

2. ####  Workout

## Technical Design

### Flowchart

The following flowchart summarises the structure and logic of the application.

<details><summary>Flowchart</summary>
<img src="docs/flowchart.png">
</details>

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for the logic of the program

### Frameworks & Tools

- [Miro.com](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/) was used to draw the flowchart
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store the project code
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console/) was used to manage access and permissions for Google Services such as Google auth, sheets etc.
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) was used to store user details, user log and exercises for user
- [PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) used to validate my python code
- [Heroku](https://https://heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project into live environment
- [Gitpod Workspace](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) used to write the project code using Code Institute template

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
- random - used to randomise the workout when generating
- re - used for random expression validation when getting user email address

#### Third Party Libraries
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used this to add color to the terminal. I marked warning/error information with color red and user feedback with blue and green.
- [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used gspread to add and manipulate data in my Google spreadsheet and to interact with Google API.
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - JUSTIFICATION: module used to set up the authentification needed to access the Google API and connect my Service Account with the Credentials function. A creds.json file is created with all details the API needs to access the google account. In deployment to Render this information is stored in the config var section.
